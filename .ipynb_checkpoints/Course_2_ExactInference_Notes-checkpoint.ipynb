    "If we wanted to predict the current time using the time present on the watches from all the students in the classroom, we know that all of these watches are correlated.  One way to represent this is to connect each watch in the classroom by a vertex in our model.  However, this generates a very complex fully-connected model.  A better way is to assume all watches are are correlated to Greenwich Mean Time (GMT), and connect each watch to this **latent variable**.  The model with this latent variable would have this structure:  \n",

    "When would we consider a directed or non-directed model?\n",

    "* Causal vs. Non-causal ordering  \n",
    "In a directed graph:  \n",
    "In the case of modeling the independencies between $X$ and $Y$, we can model all scenarios like:  \n",
    "$X \\rightarrow Y$, or  \n",
    "$X \\leftarrow Y$  \n",
    "\n",
    "However, in the case of three variables, where we start with the graph $G = X_1 \\rightarrow Y \\leftarrow X_2$. The independency modeled here is $I(G) = (X_1 \\perp X_2)$.  If we want to reverse the arrow between $Y$ and $X_2$ to generate this structure $X_1 \\rightarrow Y \\rightarrow X_2$ the independency in this new graph, $G'$, is $I(G') = (X_1 \\perp X_2 \\mid Y)$.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Unfortunately, the independencies in $G'$, specifically $(X_1 \\perp X_2 \\mid Y)$, are not found in the original model  $G$. In other words, $G'$ is not an *I-map* of $G$.   \n",
    "\n",
    "In order for the new model $G'$ to have this relationship $Y \\rightarrow X_2$, and maintain an independence structure that is contained in the original graph, we need to place a connection $X_1 \\rightarrow X_2$.  The I-map for this new graph is $\\emptyset$ and is therefore $\\subseteq G$.  \n",

    "\n",
    "The problem here is that we need to add the red-lines to maintain that all the watches are correlated to one another, resulting in the fully connected graph we were trying to avoid (by adding the latent variable) in the first place.  \n",

    "The conversation between the modeler and the domain expert (doctor) can go as follows to generate a model:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. begin with the outcome variable and ask the domain expert, \"what variables influence whether we have this outcome (e.g., lung cancer)?\"\n",
    "2. The domain expert may offer a couple variables (e.g., smoking and kind of work)\n",
    "3. then we would ask the same expert or another, what do these variables depend on.\n",
    "4. We continue to extend the conversation backwards until we reach factors that are easily determined, such as P(age) or P(gender), or P(country of origin). At this point we can stop going in this backwards direction.\n",
    "5. Now we can look in the other direction for factors that would indicate the presence or absence of the outcome variable we want to predict.  We would ask the expert for variables that are evidence of the outcome variable (e.g., coughing, bloody sputum, lung nodules present on CT scan, or positive biopsy are indicators of lung cancer).  \n",
    "6. we might then ask, \"what is the probability of a patient having cancer given a coughing?\" and the expert may say that it would depend on other variables, so we can continue extending the model in the evidencial direction until we reach simple to ascertain variables.\n",
