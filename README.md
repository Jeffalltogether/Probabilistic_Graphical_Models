# Notes for Probabilistic Graphical Models  

This repo contains notes from the lectures in the Coursera course on Probabilistic Graphical Models taught by Daphne Koller.  

I wanted to publish my notes, because I found the material necessary to understand this course was very diverse and difficult to find.   

In sharing this info, I am hoping to help others obtain the material needed to pick-up the course concepts faster.  

## Please Contribute  

It would be ideal of others could contribute to these notes by improving explanations, adding missing materials, or fixing errors.  

Thanks and good luck with the course!
