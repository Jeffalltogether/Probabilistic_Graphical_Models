% MCMCINFERENCE conducts Markov Chain Monte Carlo Inference.
%  M = MCMCInference(G, F, E, ...) performs inference given a Markov Net or Bayes Net, G, a list
%  of factors F, evidence E, and a list of parameters specifying the type of MCMC to be conducted.
%
%  G is a data structure that represents the variables in the probabilistic graphical network.  In
%  particular, it has fields
%       .names - a list of the names of all variables in the network, in order of variable index
%       .card - a list of the dimensions of all variables
%       .var2factors - a mapping of variables to which factors they are included in
%
%  F is a list of all factors in the network.
%  The factor data structure has the following fields:
%       .var    Vector of variables in the factor, e.g. [1 2 3]
%       .card    Vector of dimensions corresponding to .var, e.g. [2 2 2]
%       .val    Value table of size prod(.card)
%  E is an evidence vector, the same length as G.names, where an entry of 0 means unobserved
%
%  TransName is the name of the MCMC transition type (e.g. "Gibbs")
%
%  mix_time is the number of iterations to wait until samples are collected.  The user should
%  determine mix_time by observing behavior using the visualization framework provided.
%
%  num_samples is the number of additional samples (after the initial sample
%  following mixing) to collect
%
%  sampling_interval is the number of iterations in the chain to wait between collecting samples
%  (after mix_time has been reached). This should ALWAYS be set to 1, unless
%  memory usage is a concern in which case you may want to ignore some samples.
%
%  A0 is the initial state of the Markov Chain.  Note that it is a joint assignment to the
%  variables in G, where element is the value of the variable corresponding to the index.
