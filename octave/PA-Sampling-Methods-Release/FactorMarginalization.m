% FactorMarginalization Sums given variables out of a factor.
%   B = FactorMarginalization(A,V) computes the factor with the variables
%   in V summed out. The factor data structure has the following fields:
%       .var    Vector of variables in the factor, e.g. [1 2 3]
%       .card   Vector of cardinalities corresponding to .var, e.g. [2 2 2]
%       .val    Value table of size prod(.card)
%
%   The resultant factor should have at least one variable remaining or this
%   function will throw an error.
% 
%   See also FactorProduct.m, IndexToAssignment.m, and AssignmentToIndex.m
