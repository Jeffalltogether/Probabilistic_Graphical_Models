% FactorMaxMarginalization Max-marginalizes a factor
% by taking the max over a given set variables.
%
%   B = FactorMaxMarginalization(A,V) computes the factor with the variables
%   in V maxed out. The factor data structure has the following fields:
%       .var    Vector of variables in the factor, e.g. [1 2 3]
%       .card   Vector of cardinalities corresponding to .var, e.g. [2 2 2]
%       .val    Value table of size prod(.card)
%
%   B.var will be A.var minus V.
%   For each assignment in B, its value is the maximum value in A
%   of all assignments in A consistent with that assignment in B.
%
%   The resultant factor should have at least one variable remaining or this
%   function will throw an error.
%
%   This is exactly the same as FactorMarginalization,
%   but with the sum replaced by a max.
%
