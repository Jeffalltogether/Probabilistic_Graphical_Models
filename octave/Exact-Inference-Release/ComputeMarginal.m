%ComputeMarginal Computes the marginal over a set of given variables
%   M = ComputeMarginal(V, F, E) computes the marginal over variables V
%   in the distribution induced by the set of factors F, given evidence E
%
%   M is a factor containing the marginal over variables V
%   V is a vector containing the variables in the marginal e.g. [1 2 3] for
%     X_1, X_2 and X_3.
%   F is a vector of factors (struct array) containing the factors
%     defining the distribution
%   E is an N-by-2 matrix, each row being a variable/value pair.
%     Variables are in the first column and values are in the second column.
