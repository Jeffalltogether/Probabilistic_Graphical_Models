%CREATECLIQUETREE Takes in a list of factors F, Evidence and returns a
%clique tree after calling ComputeInitialPotentials at the end.
%
%   P = CREATECLIQUETREE(F, Evidence) Takes a list of factors and creates a clique
%   tree. The value of the cliques should be initialized to
%   the initial potential.
%   It returns a clique tree that has the following fields:
%   - .edges: Contains indices of the nodes that have edges between them.
%   - .cliqueList: Contains the list of factors used to build the Clique
%   tree.
